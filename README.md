## Pace Strategy

This is a Django-based web-application designed for cycling coaches. In this application, a coach can upload a route (GPX format), and implant his/her voice instruction over the route. When a cyclist arrives over a point, he/she hears the instruction of the coach.

## Background of the project

This project was a part of [Servoped Oy](http://servoped.com), a Finnish company. A demo version of Pace Strategy was prepared to show the product to coaches.

Servoped later decided to switch its focus to bigger and lucrative automotive market, and hence this project was scrapped.

## Built With

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) - The web framework used.
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org) - For graphical visualisation of data.
* Python version 2.7 is used for backend programming.
